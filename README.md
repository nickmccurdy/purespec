A declarative test framework for pure JavaScript.

## [Example](./src/example.js)
This executable example is meant to showcase what purified tests will look like, and it also doubles as an integration test.

## Status
__Experimental.__ There is a unit test suite so it should be at least somewhat stable, but it may undergo frequent redesigns and API breakages.

## Development
1. Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 4 or later (preferred).
2. `npm install-test`

## Contributing
- Use [JavaScript Standard Style](http://standardjs.com/). The test commands will run a compliant linter for you.
- Keep compatability with the Node engine versions (see `package.json`).
- Maintain test coverage for existing code and add at least partial unit tests for new code.
